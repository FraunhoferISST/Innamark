# Getting Started

Detailed getting started guides are described for every component in their dedicated `README`
file, located in the corresponding subfolders of the Innamark repository. In the following, an easy
start of the webinterface with the watermarker library is described.

## System Prerequisites

The following things are needed to run this application:

- docker & docker-compose

## Quick Start

To run the webinterface, just clone the repo locally and run the `docker-compose.yml` file in the
root directory of the project:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark.git
$ cd Innamark
$ docker-compose up
```

After the startup finished, try to visit the webinterface at http://localhost:8080
