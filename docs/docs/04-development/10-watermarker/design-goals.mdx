# Design Goals
 - **Extensibility**: the library is designed to allow easy extensibility for devs working on the
 core library as well as users of the library (but it has not been tested to see if this works as
intended yet). Most functions only require *interfaces* instead of specialized classes to allow
creating your own classes with different behavior.
   - *Example*: Interface
   [`FileWatermarker`](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark/blob/main/watermarker/src/commonMain/kotlin/fileWatermarker/FileWatermarker.kt)
   which allows adding support for other file types.

- **Flexibility**: for most of the functionalities we created an interface and then
implemented our *default* implementation. If this implementation does not meet the requirements, it
can be exchanged with another class implementing the interface. 
   - *Example*: class
   [`TextWatermarker`](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark/blob/main/watermarker/src/commonMain/kotlin/fileWatermarker/TextWatermarker.kt#L39)
   allows specifying your own transcoding.

- **Usage**: offering extensibility and flexibility often introduces a lot of complexity which makes it
hard to understand how the library can and should be used. To make the usage easier we created 
convenient classes and functions which reduce the flexibility but should make it easy to use the 
library for general use-cases. Only users with special requirements have to look into the more
flexible and complex API's.
   - *Example*: the classes
   [`Watermarker`](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark/blob/main/watermarker/src/commonMain/kotlin/Watermarker.kt)
   and
   [`JvmWatermarker`](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark/blob/main/watermarker/src/jvmMain/kotlin/JvmWatermarker.kt)
   offer functions to insert/extract watermarks into/from all supported file types/data without any
   additional configuration.

- **Performance**: The library **does not** focus on performance. When ever we had to make a decision
between performance and usability we chose the option for **better usability**.

- **Code quality**: The code quality is very important for us. We want to ensure that every dev is
able to work on the code base by providing documentation and enforcing a good code style by
using linters. More information are collected in the [Contributing](../../contributing)
section.

- **Testing**: For every new code added to the library, tests have to be added to validate the
functionality. This includes *unit tests* as well as *integration tests*. Furthermore, extensive
tests also provide a good point of reference for new devs on how the code should be used.

- **Error handling**: We handle errors (and warnings) as value, not as exceptions. Our library
should not throw any exceptions, instead functions which can fail should return a
[`Status`](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark/blob/main/watermarker/src/commonMain/kotlin/returnTypes/Status.kt)
or a
[`Result`](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark/blob/main/watermarker/src/commonMain/kotlin/returnTypes/Result.kt)
if they return a value. See [Concepts](../concepts/#error-handling-1) for details.

**Devs working on the project need to understand these goals and implement them in their daily
practice!**
