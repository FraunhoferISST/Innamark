# Trendmark
The watermarker library uses bytes as the watermark content. This approach is very flexible and
allows almost any content to be inserted as a watermark. However, when extracting a watermark, it is
necessary to know how to interpret the bytes. The information needed correctly interpret the bytes
can be included in the watermark at the cost of increasing the size of the watermark. This makes it
possible to extract and interpret watermarks from unknown sources, as long as they follow a
predefined specification. The Trendmark class creates and implements such a specification. The
specification is documented below.

## Overview
Trendmark uses the first byte of a watermark as tag to indicate the format. This allows to parse and
interpret the content of the watermark correctly as long as the watermark follows this
specification. The table below lists all specified tags and explains their purpose. The tags are
counted upwards from `0` for watermarks that add additional content and downwards from `fe` for
watermarks that change the content itself (e.g. compression).

| Tag (in hex) | Class name | Meaning |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 00 | RawWatermark | raw bytes without special encoding |
| 01 | SizedWatermark | size + raw bytes |
| 02 | CRC32Watermark | CRC32 checksum + raw bytes |
| 03 | SizedCRC32Watermark | size + CRC32 checksum + raw bytes |
| 04 | SHA3256Watermark | SHA3-256 hash + raw bytes |
| 05 | SizedSHA3256Watermark | size + SHA3-256 hash + raw bytes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| fe | CompressedRawWatermark | compressed bytes |
| fd | CompressedSizedWatermark | size + compressed bytes |
| fc | CompressedCRC32Watermark | CRC32 checksum + compressed bytes |
| fb | CompressedSizedCRC32Watermark | size + CRC32 checksum + compressed bytes |
| fa | CompressedSHA3256Watermark | SHA3-256 hash + compressed bytes |
| f9 | CompressedSizedSHA3256Watermark | size + SHA3-256 hash + compressed bytes |
| -- | -- | -- |
| ff | Custom | Reserved for custom Trendmark implementations |

## Details
In the following, each watermark is specified with the text ``Lorem Ipsum`` encoded in UTF-8 bytes
(4c 6f 72 65 6d 20 69 70 73 75 6d) as example watermark content. All values are in hexadecimal
format.
The compressed variants use DEFLATE as compression algorithm (see RFC 1951).
Compressing the example watermark content results in the bytes (f3 c9 2f 4a cd 55 f0 2c 28 2e cd 05
00), which is larger because the example content is too small to be effectively compressed.
Only the content is compressed, potentially allowing to use the additional information to increase 
the watermark robustness.

| -- | -- |
| 00 | 4c 6f 72 65 6d 20 69 70 73 75 6d |

### SizedWatermark
