# Watermarker

## Differentiation: Watermarking vs. Watermarks
 - **Watermark**: the content that gets inserted into a cover file/data
 - **Watermarking**: the algorithm/strategy to insert a watermark into a cover file/data

Our library can insert arbitrary bytes (watermarks) into all supported file types/data (cover).
If your watermark does not align with bytes, you must integrate your own padding scheme.

We also developed a strategy to support creating and parsing watermarks. This is completely
optional, you can choose to use our strategy or create your own. Below, you can find an example for
our strategy to create and parse watermarks that contain text as content.

## General Information
The library is designed to allow watermarking bytes into any support file type or data. However,
the current development focus is on watermarking plain text and is currently the only fully
supported file type. If you want to integrate your own watermarking schema, you can easily integrate
it into our library. See the [Development](../../development/watermarker) section of the watermarker for more details.

### TextWatermarker Customizations
The
[`PlainTextWatermarker`](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark/blob/main/watermarker/src/commonMain/kotlin/watermarkers/text/PlainTextWatermarker.kt#L128)
is designed to allow customizing its behavior in many ways:
- changing how watermarks are separated
   - empty insert position
   - one char between watermarks
   - one char at the beginning of a watermark and another at the end
- changing the transcoding
   - the transcoding converts the watermark bytes into characters and back

However, we do not provide preconfigured configuration options for these adjustments, you have to
read the code and then create your own implementaitons.

### Extraction Customizations
The Extraction functions of the (Jvm-)Watermarker allow for passing additional parameters for
specific use cases, **bold** indicates default values for (Jvm-)Watermarker in kotlin:
- [`squash`](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark/blob/main/watermarker/src/commonMain/kotlin/watermarkers/text/PlainTextWatermarker.kt#L611)
= [**true**/false]: when true duplicate Watermarks are squashed together and only one copy is
returned
- [`singleWatermark`](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark/blob/main/watermarker/src/commonMain/kotlin/types/watermarks/Watermark.kt#L30)
= [**true**/false]: when true only the most frequent Watermark is returned
    - if multiple Watermarks appear with the same (highest) frequency a warning is returned with the Watermarks
    - this is separate from the squashing above, duplicates of the most frequent Watermark(s) are still returned if squash = false
- [`errorOnInvalidUTF8`](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark/blob/main/watermarker/src/commonMain/kotlin/types/watermarks/InnamarkTagBuilder.kt#L132)
= [true/**false**]: For functions returning InnamarkTagBuilders only, when true throws a
CharacterCodingException when encountering malformed UTF8 Bytes
- [`validateAll`](https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark/blob/main/watermarker/src/commonMain/kotlin/types/watermarks/InnamarkTag.kt#L56)
= [**true**/false]: For functions returning InnamarkTags only, when true calls the
InnamarkTag validate() function, which will check for valid characteristics depending on the
InnamarkTag type. See the [InnamarkTag Development](../../development/watermarker/InnamarkTag) section for more
details.

## Kotlin Library: Special Characteristics
Kotlin uses so-called
[companion objects](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html#companion-objects) to
provide static function. Most of our classes are providing static functions to create an instance
instead of a constructor. To create an instance of such a class in Java or JavaScript, you must not
use the `new` operated. Instead, you have to use `ClassName.Companion.someInstantiationFunction(..)`.
See
[Java Example](./java/#example-watermarking-text-with-text)
of `Main.java` for an example.
