# Watermarker

## Differentiation: Watermarking vs. Watermarks
 - Watermark: the content that gets insert into a file/data
 - Watermarking: the algorithm/strategy to insert a watermark into a file/data

Our library can insert arbitrary bytes into all supported file types/data. If your watermark does
not align with bytes, you must integrate your own padding scheme.

We also developed a strategy to support creating and parsing watermarks. This is completely
optional, you can choose to use our strategy or create your own. Below you can find an example for
our strategy to create and parse watermarks that contain text as content.

## General Information
The library is designed to allow watermarking bytes into any support file type or data. However,
the current development focus is on watermarking plain text and is currently the only fully
supported file type. If you want to integrate your own watermarking schema you can easily integrate
it into our library, see [Development](../../development/watermarker) for details.

### TextWatermarker customizations
The TextWatermarker is designed to allow customizing its behavior in many ways:
- changing how watermarks are separated
   - empty insert position
   - one char between watermarks
   - one char at the beginning of a water and another at the end
- changing the transcoding
   - the transcoding converts the watermark bytes into characters and back

However, we do not provide preconfigured configuration options for these adjustments, you have to
read the code and then create your own implementaitons.

## Kotlin Library: Special Characteristics
Kotlin uses so-called
[companion objects](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/object-declarations.html#companion-objects) to
provide static function. Most of our classes are providing static functions to create an instance
instead of a constructor. To create an instance of such class in Java or JavaScript you must not use 
the `new` operated. Instead you have to use `ClassName.Companion.someInstantiationFunction(..)`.
See
[Java Example](./java/#example-watermarking-text-with-text)
line 28 of `Main.java` for an example.
