## About

The *Invisible Watermarking* (Innamark) project aims to address some of the current
challenges in implementing data sovereignty solutions on a broader scale. The objective is to use
state-of-the-art digital watermarking techniques to embed metadata securely in the data being
exchanged, along with dedicated protocol-level checks for validation and enforcement. This enables
system-independent sovereignty checks to secure the data assets of the data owner without privacy
sacrifices.

This repository includes a generic **steganography / watermarking** library to hide any byte
encoded data in a cover text including two usage examples of a webinterface and command line
tool. The following example shows how the webinterface includes the watermark "Fraunhofer ISST"
inside a Lorem ipsum dummy cover text and extracts it afterward:

## üìñ Documentation

All information from usage until development are collected and provided in our
[documentation](https://fraunhoferisst.github.io/Innamark/).

## üìÅ Structure

This project uses a [monolithic repository approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) and
consists of different parts, located in different subfolders. The heart is a **watermarker
library**, located in the `watermarker` folder, used by other components like a CLI
tool or a webinterface shipped with this repo. Every part has its own `README` file to get further
information.

### Subfolder Overview

- **cli**: A command line tool to enable watermarking directly via a shell
- **docs**: The [documentation](https://fraunhoferisst.github.io/Innamark/) of all parts based on Docusaurus
- **samples**: Different examples of watermarked and non-watermarked files, mainly used for tests
- **watermarker**: The heart part of the repository: A Kotlin watermarker library for hiding text (a watermark) inside a cover text. The library works on the JVM (Java) and JavaScript (JS) platform
- **webinterface**: A frontend / GUI to use the watermarking inside a browser, build with
  [KVision](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Detailed getting started guides are described for every component in their dedicated `README`
file, located in the corresponding subfolders. In the following, an easy start of the webinterface
with the watermarker library is described.

### System Prerequisites

The following things are needed to run this application:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Quick Start

To run the webinterface, just clone the repo locally and run the `docker-compose.yml` file in the
root directory of the project:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/FraunhoferISST/Innamark.git
$ cd Innamark
$ docker compose up
```

After the startup finished, try to visit the webinterface at http://localhost:8080
